## How to start the dev server

If it is your first time running the dev server you need to install all the dependencies using `npm`. Execute the following command in the root of the root folder where `package.json` is located.

```bash
# Installs all the dependencies
npm install
```
Make sure to run the above command again every time the dependecies change.

Once you have all the packages installed you can start the dev server by executing one of the following commands: 

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building for Production
